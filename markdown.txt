This is an example inspired by [GitHub](https://github.com)

console.log('Hello, World!');
```

## Heading 2

There is **bold** and *italics* for emphasis.

There are qoutes.
> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Longer Code Blocks:

```js
// Using 'typeof' to infer types
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
type PersonType = typeof person;  // { name: string; age: number }

// 'satisfies' to ensure a type matches but allows more specific types
type Animal = { name: string };
const dog = { name: "Buddy", breed: "Golden Retriever" } satisfies Animal;

// Generics with 'extends' and default values
function identity<T extends number | string = string>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let str = identity();  // Default type is string
let num = identity(42);  // T inferred as number
```

Math:

$$
\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(
	\dfrac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}_k}
\right) - \dfrac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q_k} = 0
$$
